As you will see in a minute, SVM is quite slow to train, even on our really small training set, so I'm going to restrict the number of combinations we're looking at._\n",

Then it will pass those hyperparameter settings into into `SVC` and it will use that setting and run Cross Validation. So because we're doing 5 fold CV, it will loop through the 5 subsets of data, each time fitting on 4 and evaluating on the 5th. Then it will store the average test score for that loop (and other things). It will do this for each hyperparameter combination._\n",
